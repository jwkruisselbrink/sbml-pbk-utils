  ## Physiology

  ### Age
  AgeInit = 10       # body weight at start of simulation [kg]

  BWRef = 50         # reference body weight [kg]
  AgeRef = 18        # reference age [kg]

  Age = AgeInit      # age during simulation [yr]

  ### Body size
  BWBirth = 3.5      # body weight at start of simulation [kg]
  BWAdult = 70.0     # asymptotic/mature body weight [kg]
  kGrowth = 0.2      # growth-rate constant [1/h]

  BW := deltaBW * f_BW(Age, BWBirth, BWAdult, kGrowth)        # body weight during simulation [kg]

  ### Compartment sizes
  VRc = 0.9003       # rest-of-body volume as fraction body weight [L/kg]
  VLc = 0.0257       # liver volume as fraction of body weight [L/kg]
  VBc = 0.074        # blood volume as fraction of body weight [L/kg]

  ### Flow rates
  QCC = 15           # cardiac output as function of body weight [L/h/kg^0.75]
  QRc = 0.773        # fraction of blood flow to rest-of-body [-]
  QLc = 0.227        # fraction of blood flow to liver [-]

  ## Biochemical parameters

  ### Partition coefficients
  PCLiver = 2        # partition coefficient liver:blood [-]

  ### Metabolism and excretion
  CLUrine = 10       # urinary excretion rate [L/h]

  ### Absorption
